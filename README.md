# SLAM-dockerfile-cheatsheet

## Motivation  
SLAM(simultaneous localization and mapping) have different dependencies for each algorithm. Adjusting these all dependencies to the local computer is very challenging. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a powerful tool, you could solve these problem at once.   

This repository helps you to make Dockerfile easier what you want.

## Useful Dockerfile commands  
Supported by ChatGPT & [Reference](https://biocorecrg.github.io/CoursesCRG_Containers_Nextflow_May_2021/docker-recipes.html) 
- **`FROM`** : Specifies the base image that will be used for the Docker image.  
- **`WORKDIR`** : Sets the working directory for subsequent commands in the Dockerfile. 
- **`RUN`** : Runs a command inside the Docker image during the build process. This can be used to install packages, run scripts, and perform other setup tasks. 
- **`COPY`** or **`ADD`** :  Copies files from the host machine to the Docker image. This can be used to add application code, configuration files, and other assets to the image.
- **`ENV`** : Sets environment variables inside the Docker image.  
- **`CMD`** or **`ENTRYPOINT`**: Specifies the command that will be executed when the container is started. `CMD` is used to specify a default command, while `ENTRYPOINT` is used to specify a command that should always be run when the container is started.
